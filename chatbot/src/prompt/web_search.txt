**Web Search Protocol:**
- Use web search when current information is needed; otherwise answer from existing knowledge
- Generate optimized keywords by analyzing chat history, user intent, and time sensitivity
- Make individual tool calls for each distinct search purpose
- Prioritize reliable sources and combine multiple search results when available
- If web search fails or returns inadequate results, respond using available knowledge and clearly indicate limitations
